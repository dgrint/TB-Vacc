# This is a template repo
 
This is a template repository. It contains the basic file structure we should maintain across all our working repos.

After creating a new repository using this template, please complete these steps:

* Update the README.md file: Give the repo a meaningful title and add some descriptive text in the README.md
* Clone the new repository to your local workspace.
* Start adding files to your new repo and commit them.
* When ready, push the commits to upload the new files to the IMPALATRIAL github organisation area.

NOTE: Do not delete the .gitignore txt files. They are required in order to maintain the file structure when no other files are present.
